# ImageBrightnessAnalysis
Approach Method
Step 1: Import packages like OpenCv, numpy, sys, os in Annaconda
Step 2: Accepting an image as user input while compiling from command prompt
Step 3: Then depending upon the user action we are able to convert the image to either GrayScale or to HSV image format
Step 4: Then we calculated the Average brightness of the image
Step 5: Then we matched the average brightness value to the list of brightness range we maintained in a tuple
Step 6: We display the output for the respective range


Steps to Execute
Prerequisite: System should have installed with python version 3.7.4 or Anaconda
Anaconda Command prompt should be available in the system 
Import packages like OpenCv, numpy, sys, os in Annaconda
